## Game Intructions

The game establishes a creative, fun twist on the classic memory game. A key is 
provided that shows the pairs you're trying to locate. Each match represents a
word, phrase or place. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, keep the
pairs if they match and continue their turn. If there is no match, the next player 
takes their turn. The game ends when all the matches are found or when 35 turns 
are up, th player with the most pairs wins.

Memory games like this are an fun entertaining way to help strengthen cognitive 
skills by boosting focus, improving recall and training the brain to recognize
patterns, all of which support overall mental sharpness and development.

## Background

I chose this game simply because, coming in with absolutely no experience in 
coding, I weighed my option and picked what i thought would be a simple exercise.
***Spoiler Alert***... it was hard as **F*!** There were moments when I literally
wanted to hurl my iMac through the wall, moments of anxiety, which for me means 
itching fits! However, through the guidance of the awesome teachers and my peers 
who stepped up when I was honestly ready to tap out aided me in the process of 
making it through. This project definately pushed my limits in the best and wildest
ways possible.


## Attributions

Since I see the bigger picture before I see the steps on how to get there, I'm always
looking for ways to break things down to comprehend them better. This **YouTube** video
on flowcharts really helped me make the coding experience a lil bit easier. Of course the 
**MDN** website is my new go to, to play around with different functions and correct syntax.
The **Flex-Box** website was also very useful. I used _javaScript_, _HTML_ and _CSS._

## Next Steps

The original concept for this memory game actually started as more of an adult version
using emojis...**IYKYK!!** **Muy Caliente′!!!** 😜🥵🌶️ For couples to play, connect, 
communicate and have a lil fun together. With my background in health and wellness, I'm
all about helping people bond in enjoyable ways, because when something feels fun, it 
doesn'y neccessarily feel like work. I still plan on bringing the idea to fruition with
interactive features, animations, music and maybe evenlevels for dating couples, long 
term partners and married pros. The sky is the limit, I'm excited to see where it goes!
